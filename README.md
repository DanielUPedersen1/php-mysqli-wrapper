# php-mysqli-wrapper
Having struggled to find a secure, easy, wrapper to use with php for MySQLi that would prevent SQL Injection attacks, and also make encryption easy, I decided to make my own. This PHP MySQLi wrapper makes database integration easy, and aims to improve the development timeline for PHP developers. The class makes use of dynamically generated prepared statements based on the query you are preforming, and the database you are preforming it on, while securely escaping all user input before the query. It uses the Halite PHP encryption library by Paragon Initiative in the background, to keep the data you need secure, with just a modification the the initial class instantiation.
